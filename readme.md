Mascots VS Mascots

This app is for those, like me, who are frequently being forced to watch a football game but do not know anything about football. Instead of rooting for a team based on their skill or your loyalty, you will pick a team to root for based on their mascot. This is a place to post the mascots of the teams playing. You can add what you think their particluar strengths and weaknesses are and join the fun that way.
